# NumPy Data Explorer

## 📌 Project Overview
NumPy Data Explorer is a beginner-level Python project developed to explore and analyze numerical data using the NumPy library.  
This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of NumPy such as array creation, indexing, slicing, mathematical and statistical operations, reshaping, broadcasting, saving/loading arrays, and performance comparison with Python lists.

This project helps in understanding why NumPy is faster and more efficient for numerical computations and is suitable for MCA students.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To learn NumPy array creation and manipulation
- To perform indexing and slicing on arrays
- To apply mathematical and statistical operations
- To understand reshaping and broadcasting
- To save and load NumPy arrays using .npy files
- To compare NumPy performance with Python lists

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## ⚙ Features Implemented

### 1. Array Creation
- Created 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Used NumPy functions like array(), arange(), zeros(), and ones()

### 2. Indexing & Slicing
- Accessed individual elements from arrays
- Performed slicing on 1D arrays
- Extracted rows and columns from 2D arrays

### 3. Mathematical Operations
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Element-wise operations using NumPy arrays

### 4. Statistical Operations
- Mean
- Median
- Maximum and minimum
- Standard deviation

### 5. Reshaping & Broadcasting
- Reshaped arrays using reshape()
- Performed broadcasting operations for efficient computation

### 6. Save & Load NumPy Arrays
- Saved arrays using np.save()
- Loaded arrays using np.load()
- Stored arrays in .npy binary format

### 7. Performance Comparison
- Compared execution time of:
  - Python lists
  - NumPy arrays
- Demonstrated that NumPy performs faster for large numerical computations
